ZooperInstaller
===============

Zooper installer project. 


This library is required for what I have so-far to function:
https://github.com/ManuelPeinado/FadingActionBar

You'll need the "Stock" version as a library to the main project. This COULD also be compatible with ActionBarSherlock, but I try to avoid that. 

The wallpaper activity can easily be converted into a fragment, as well, if needed. I'm just not sure how to move the "Apply" button into the ActionBar.
